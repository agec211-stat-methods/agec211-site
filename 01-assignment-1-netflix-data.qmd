**Course Title**: Agec211: Statistical methods <br> **Instructor**: Christopher Llones <br> **Assignment**: Netflix Dataset Analysis in R <br> **Due Date**: 9 October 2025

## Objective

This assignment will assess your ability to apply R programming skills—specifically using the `dplyr` package and the pipe operator (`%>%`)—to explore and analyze a real-world dataset. You will work with the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset to answer questions using code.

## Instructions

-   Use R and the `dplyr` package to answer each question.

-   Submit your `R script file (.R)` with your code and outputs.

-   Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) for all data manipulations.

-   You may use additional packages like `tidyr` or `stringr` if needed.

-   Ensure your code is clean, commented, and reproducible.

## Questions

**Part 1: Data exploration**

1.  How many rows and columns are in the dataset?

2.  List all unique types of content (e.g., Movie, TV Show).

3.  How many titles were released in 2020?

**Part 2: filtering and summarising**

4.  Filter the dataset to show only TV Shows released in India. How many are there?

5.  Find the top 5 most common ratings.

6.  Which year had the most titles added to Netflix?

**Part 3: grouping and aggregation**

7.  Group the data by `type` and count how many entries each type has.

8.  Group the data by `release_year` and summarize the number of titles released per year.

9.  Which country has produced the most content on Netflix?

**Advanced Filtering**

10. Filter the dataset to show all Movies with a duration longer than 100 minutes.

11. Find all titles directed by 'Steven Spielberg'.

12. List all titles with the genre containing 'Documentary'.

**Bonus Challenge**

13. Create a new column that extracts the number of seasons for TV Shows. Then, find the average number of seasons.

14. Which actor appears most frequently across all titles?

## Grading rubrics

| Criteria | Excellent (5pts) | Good (4pts) | Fair (2-3 pts) | Needs improvement (0-1 pt) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Code accuracy** | All answers are correct and match expected outputs. | Most answers are correct with minor errors. | Several answers are incorrect or incomplete. | Many answers are missing or incorrect. |
| **Use of** `dplyr` **Functions** | Consistently uses appropriate `dplyr` verbs (`filter`, `mutate`, `summarise`, etc.). | Uses `dplyr` functions correctly in most cases. | Uses some `dplyr` functions but inconsistently or incorrectly. | Rarely uses `dplyr` or misuses functions. |
| **Pipe Operator Usage (**`%>%`**)** | Pipe operator is used fluently and correctly throughout. | Mostly correct usage with occasional syntax issues. | Used sporadically or with frequent errors. | Not used or used incorrectly. |
| **Data Manipulation & Filtering** | Demonstrates strong understanding of filtering, grouping, and summarizing. | Shows good grasp with minor gaps. | Basic filtering and grouping attempted but lacks depth. | Little to no meaningful data manipulation. |
| **Insight & Interpretation** | Provides thoughtful insights or observations where applicable. | Some interpretation is present. | Minimal interpretation or unclear reasoning. | No interpretation or irrelevant commentary. |
| **Bonus Challenge (Q13–Q14)** | Completed with correct logic and creative approach. | Attempted with mostly correct logic. | Attempted but contains errors or lacks clarity. | Not attempted or incorrect. |
| **Reproducibility** | Code runs without errors and produces expected results. | Minor issues but generally reproducible. | Some errors prevent full reproducibility. | Code fails to run or produces major errors. |
